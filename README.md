## Distill pretraind diffusion-based generative model using the techniques described in the paper "Score identity Distillation: Exponentially Fast Distillation of Pretrained Diffusion Models for One-Step Generation"

This folder contains the code to reproduce the results of SiD on distilling pretrained EDM diffusion models. SiD outperforms the teacher EDM model in all datasets except for ImageNet 64x64.

The one-step generators produced by SiD are provided in ...
